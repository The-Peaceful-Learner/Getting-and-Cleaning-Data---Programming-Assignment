# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data---Programming-Assignment
DESCRIPTION: My solution repository for Getting and Cleaning Data - Programming Assignment

The repository contains the following files:

1. The script run_analysis.R which:
  i. Merges the training and test datasets to create one dataset
  ii. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
  iii. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set - the activity names are appended as a new column to the dataset obtained in step i
  iv. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
  v. From the data set in step iv, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
  
2. Cookbook - Original Dataset
   Describes in detail the methodology used to arrive at the original dataset and all the files available in the dataset


3. The final tidy dataset file - FinalSummary_Activity_Subject-wise_AvgValues.txt:
   It contains the tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
